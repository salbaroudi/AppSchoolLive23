## App User Documentation File:

The %delta desk consists of a pair of applications (%delta and %delta-follower).  This pair of tutorial apps are designed to illustrate the following concepts to ASL 
learners:

- Pokes
- Subscriptions
- Basic State Manipulation (via a list that acts as a stack, with %pop and %push operations).


### Setting up %delta and %delta-follower:

- Once the two applicaitons have been installed (in Dojo console), A running session can be setup, for a learner to experiment with.

The applications accept the following actions:

-  *%delta:*
    + Pokes
        + [%push target=@p value=@] 
        + [%pop target=@p] 
    + Subscriptions (update responses):
        + [%init values=(list @)]
    + Scries/Peeks

- **%delta-follower:**
    + Pokes (via ++on-poke arm):
        + [%sub target=@p]
        + [%unsub target=@p]
    + Responses (from %delta, via ++on-agent arm)
        + [%watch-ack]
        + [%kick]
        + [%fact] (for state updates, sent by subscriber wire)

- A typical session, to setup the two agents (for experimentation), is below. To interact with agents, use `:agent-name &action-name [inputs...]` notation on the Dojo
command line.

(1) Setup the %delta stack:

```
> :delta  &delta-action [%push ~zod 10.000]
> :delta  &delta-action [%push ~zod 20.000]
> :delta  &delta-action [%push ~zod 30.000]
```


(2) Subscribe to %delta-with %delta-follower:

```
> :delta-follower [%sub ~zod]
```

(3)  Pop from the %delta stack, get a response over wire with %delta-follower:

```
> :delta &delta-action [%pop ~zod]
```

4) Cancel Subscription:

```
> :delta-follower [%unsub ~zod]
```
