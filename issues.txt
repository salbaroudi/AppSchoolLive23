- I get nacks, but not acks.
- Wait, so do we send acks or not?? I am confused. How often do we resend a packet
if we didn't get an ack? How long do we wait?

- Can we call ls or cat with a scry call?  Is that what the %say gen is for?

Q2: I guessed:
=> Build Code: Gall 
=> Start agents on a desk when |install is run: Gall


- why does charlie-action get routed to /charlie/action.hoon? Why is it not /charlie-action.hoon?

- need help understanding on-load in /app/charlie.hoon

- For our scry: .^((list @) %gx /=charlie=/values/noun). Where exactly is /values/noun located?? In Clay somewhere?
