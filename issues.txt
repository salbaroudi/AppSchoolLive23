- I get nacks, but not acks.
- Wait, so do we send acks or not?? I am confused. How often do we resend a packet
if we didn't get an ack? How long do we wait?

- Can we call ls or cat with a scry call?  Is that what the %say gen is for?

Q2: I guessed:
=> Build Code: Gall 
=> Start agents on a desk when |install is run: Gall


- why does charlie-action get routed to /charlie/action.hoon? Why is it not /charlie-action.hoon?

- need help understanding on-load in /app/charlie.hoon

- For our scry: .^((list @) %gx /=charlie=/values/noun). Where exactly is /values/noun located?? In Clay somewhere?

- So if an agent crashes (!!), is it still running?

- always merge from base. NEVER alter base (!!)
    => Even if you restore your desk.bill, your vere instance will never load correctly again :(.


- why would we subscribe, accept gift and leave, over just scrying?

"Sometimes an agent's interactions with a web interface are totally distinct from its interactions with other agents. If so,
 the agent could just have separate scry endpoints, poke handlers, etc, that directly deal with +$json data with a %json mark.
  In such a case, you can include +$json encoding/decoding functions directly in the agent or associated libraries, using the general 
  techniques demonstrated in the +$json encoding and decoding example section below.
"
=> Can we ever get away with minimal mark/sur files, or none at all? Is that possible?

-json test: what is the |^ really saying? need help with this.
    - namespacing issue
